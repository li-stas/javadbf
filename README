JavaDBF
===========

JavaDBF is a Java library for reading and writing Xbase files.
This was written when I was in need of a program to communicate 
with a legacy application which could read and write only 
dBASE III files. And JavaDBF just does that job.

It does not implement JDBC interfaces but it has a simple API of 
its own. JavaDBF library is not thread safe. I tested only with 
dBASE III format though the structure can hold other formats like
FlagShip, dBASE IV etc. If anyone succeeds in that and please let be know
about it. Also please send the patch, if any, across to me.

I could not find any authoritative documentation on the structure
of Xbase files. I ran a search in Google and it came up with a 
a few links and I used them; it worked fine.

Latest version JavaDBF will be available at: 
http://sarovar.org/projects/javadbf/
